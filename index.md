# Glove Controlled Robotic Hand
My project is a robotic servo motor hand controlled by a glove and flex sensors. It uses multiple servo motors that pull strings to make the fingers move, with a spring that will put it back upright. The servo motors are controlled by C++ code from an Arduino, which links a glove that uses flex senors to see how much the fingers should bend.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was my modification, which was turning the foam robotic hand into a 3d printed robotic hand. The first step was to use Fusion 360 to CAD all of the different parts of the hand. This includes the 3 segments of the fingers, the palm, the finger mounts, and the wrist. I modeled the hand based off of the dimensions of the foam hand fingers, however I ended up making the fingers longer and scaling up the rest of the hand a bit to fit all of the electrical components and even the glove. I made sure to model holes for the springs and the strings. I also found screws and nuts in the spares box that I measured and modeled the fingers to fit with in order to attach the segments. I struggled a bit to get to the perfect finger, taking me 3 tries to get it right. The first try, I put a circular cutout for the inside of the finger segments to attach to the circular part of the next segment, however that makes it impossible for the segments to move. The second try, it was impossible for the spring to bend as there was no cut out area for it and it was hard to feed the strings through, since the area between the fingers was open. After getting all of the pieces printed out, I realized that the springs aren't long enough or strong enough to hold up the fingers, since the fingers are much heavier for the spring to carry. I fixed this by getting 6 inch springs rather than 4 inch springs and reinforced them with an elastic cord in the middle of it with pretension and rubber bands between the finger mount and the bottom segment, as that intersection holds the most weight. Then, when I tried to attach the servos to the strings to pull them, I realized that the micro servos weren’t strong enough to pull the strings to move the fingers, since the 3d printed fingers weigh a lot more. The fingers were also longer, meaning the string would have to be pulled farther. Because of this, I had to get bigger, stronger servos, which I modified the spinners on them to be longer. The original plan was to have the micro servos be next to each other in the hand, however, the bigger servos didn’t fit that way, which led me to stacking them on top of each other, which worked out great. In the end, I was able to get 4 of the servos in the hand, pulling the strings, moving the fingers, and responding to the flex sensors. The most enjoyable part of it all was seeing everything finally work. To get to this milestone took 3 and a half weeks, so seeing all of the effort pay off to create a massive, working robotic gauntlet, felt so great, especially because there were so many errors and challenges.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was building the hand, making the glove, and putting everything together to create the product. The hand is made of foam, with each finger being 3 segments with 2 holes each, 1 for the spring to keep it up straight, and 1 for the fishing line which you pull to move the finger. I connected the strings to their own servo motors from the basic circuit in milestone 1, testing to see if the motors would pull the string and move the fingers. Then, I attached the palm to the wrist, then the fingers to the palm, placed the motors on the wrist, and tested it with the potentiometers. I wasn't able to put on the thumb because the wrist didn't have space for a fifth servo. Once the foam hand was connected to the electrical component[s], I moved on to making the flex sensor glove, which was just flex sensors put on each finger of the hand. Then I replaced the potentiometers with the flex sensors in the circuit, making the foam fingers move when the glove fingers are moved. The most enjoyable part was seeing all of the parts come together and being able to move my fingers in the glove and see the giant foam fingers move too. The most challenging part was the putting together of all of the parts, since all of the parts, the motors, the fingers, the glove, all worked separately, but when they were put together, things kept going wrong. For example, the motors would be ripped off from the wrist, or the string would fall off of the motor. Eventually, every little problem was solved bit by bit, making the hand finally work.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was making the basic electrical component for the hand mechanism, except the flex sensors were replaced with potentiometers to test everything first [what?]. The circuit works by having the 5 motors for the 5 fingers connected to the 5 tilde [what does tilde mean?] digital pins and having the 5 potentiometers connected to 5 analog pins [optional: why did you specify analog pins here?]. Each potentiometer and motor are connected to the 5V and ground pins on the Arduino. The code works by connecting the inputs [connecting inputs to what] from the potentiometer, changing them from analog to digital, and mapping them to be in the domain of the servo motors, which are 0-180 [what is 0-180 domain exactly? why do the motors magically understand these numbers?]. This allows the potentiometers to control the rotation of the motors. The most enjoyable part was seeing all of the motors be controlled by the individual potentiometers after hours of troubleshooting. The most challenging part of this milestone was making sure all of the wiring was correct, since there were so many different wires that had to be in the perfect location in order to work. Another very challenging part was that we only had 4 good potentiometers, so the fifth one had very tiny pins that weren’t able to stick to anything for long, leading to very glitchy motors.

pretty good, just be prepared for the [] statements OR straight up answer them in this website!

# Starter Project: Useless Machine
  

My starter project was the useless machine, which is a machine where you flip the switch, and it flips the switch back, turning it back off. It works by having the switch turn on the motor, which moves the plastic arm/tail piece that pushes the switch back down, opening a rotating door to do so. The switch turning back off makes the motor move the plastic piece back to where it was before. Two limit switches [what are these limit switches?] stop the motor from rotating endlessly in both directions, allowing it to stop and switch direction, or just stay in one place. There’s also a two colored LED on the inside that shows which way the switch is, when it’s turned up, it’s green, when it’s turned down, it’s red [turning up/down doesnt exist, it just has 3 legs, 2 are activated at any moment]. The challenges I had in making this were soldering and putting the screws in the posts. Prior to this, I had never soldered before, so I had to learn to do it while working on this project, which I got pretty quickly. However, I did make a few mistakes that were a challenge to fix. The first problem I had was having the piece I was trying to solder slide downwards, so when I finished and flipped the board over, it was way above the board. In order to fix this, I had to add more solder to connect the points and melt them together, allowing me to push the piece to be flush with the board and fix it. Another problem I had was accidentally filling the holes on the board with solder. In order to overcome this problem, I had to keep melting the solder in it, then using the suction tool right over the hole to get it out. After doing it over and over, I was finally able to figure it out, and did it for 2 holes. The other main challenge I had was [with] the posts, which were part of the main box. Putting the tiny screws into the posts was a huge challenge because they just didn’t fit very well, and I had to just press really hard with a perfect screwdriver. I even accidentally broke part of the box while doing so, which I fixed with super glue, but I eventually overcame the challenge and got all the screws in.

whichx6 / try to limit commas, some, aren't, needed / descriptions are somewhat hard to follow- simplify them somehow?
