# Glove Controlled Robotic Hand
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was building the hand, making the glove, and putting everything together to create the product. The hand is made of foam, with each finger being 3 segments with 2 holes each, 1 for the spring to keep it up straight, and 1 for the fishing line which you pull to move the finger. I connected the strings to their own servo motors from the basic circuit in milestone 1, testing to see if the motors would pull the string and move the fingers. Then, I attached the palm to the wrist, then the fingers to the palm, placed the motors on the wrist, and tested it with the potentiometers. I wasn't able to put on the thumb because the wrist didn't have space for a fifth servo. Once the foam hand was connected to the electrical component, I moved on to making the flex sensor glove, which was just flex sensors put on each finger of the hand. Then I replaced the potentiometers with the flex sensors in the circuit, making the foam fingers move when the glove fingers are moved. The most enjoyable part was seeing all of the parts come together and being able to move my fingers in the glove and see the giant foam fingers move too. The most challenging part was the putting together of all of the parts, since all of the parts, the motors, the fingers, the glove, all worked separately, but when they were put together, things kept going wrong. For example, the motors would be ripped off from the wrist, or the string would fall off of the motor. Eventually, every little problem was solved bit by bit, making the hand finally work.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was making the basic electrical component for the hand mechanism, except the flex sensors were replaced with potentiometers to test everything first. The circuit works by having the 5 motors for the 5 fingers connected to the 5 tilde digital pins and having the 5 potentiometers connected to 5 analog pins. Each potentiometer and motor are connected to the 5V and ground pins on the Arduino. The code works by connecting the inputs from the potentiometer, changing them from analog to digital, and mapping them to be in the domain of the servo motors, which are 0-180. This allows the potentiometers to control the rotation of the motors. The most enjoyable part was seeing all of the motors be controlled by the individual potentiometers after hours of troubleshooting. The most challenging part of this milestone was making sure all of the wiring was correct, since there were so many different wires that had to be in the perfect location in order to work. Another very challenging part was that we only had 4 good potentiometers, so the fifth one had very tiny pins that weren’t able to stick to anything for long, leading to very glitchy motors.

# Starter Project: Useless Machine
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.
